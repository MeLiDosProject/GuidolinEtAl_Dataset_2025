### About this repository

This repository contains the comprehensive dataset for the field study site of Tuebingen, Germany. Data were collected by the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (MPI KYB)](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en) and are further processed and analysed by the [Translational Sensory & Circadian Neuroscience Unit (TSCN)](https://www.tscnlab.org). This dataset precedes the [MeLiDos](www.melidos.eu) protocol [Guidolin et al., 2024](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39592960) and was partly used to shape the protocol. Thus, while the data in this repository share many similarities with other datasets published after [Guidolin et al., 2024](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39592960), some differences remain. A detailed description of the data is available in the [legacy dataset repository](https://github.com/tscnlab/GuidolinEtAl_Dataset_2025).

This repository is transitioning towards a [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and fully human and machine-readable light exposure dataset, based on a [community-based and peer-reviewed Metadata descriptor](https://bmcdigitalhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44247-024-00113-9). As part of this transition, files will be converted from semi-rectangular data, to fully [tabular data](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/). Further, metadata will be added and converted from XLSX to JSON. For full traceability, all versions will be archived in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and are accessible through their own persistent identifier (DOI).

# Folder structure

## Group

This folder contains grouped data, i.e. any data that are collected at the group level and/or were grouped to facilitate import during analyses.

| Folder name | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **actlumus** | N=26 files from ActLumus, one for each participant |
| **acttrust** | N=26 files from ActTrust2, one for each participant |
| **chronotype** | N=2 csv files, one for the Morning Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and one for the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). Each contains data for N=26 participants.  |
| **demographics** | N=2 csv files. “201_231_demog_20231123.csv” contains only demographic information for N=26 participants. “201_231_demog_health_20231123.csv” contains both demographic as well as health information for N=26 participants. |
| **discharge** | N=1 csv file, which contains answers from all N=5 questionnaires that N=26 participants had to fill at discharge: 1) Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA instrument), 2) Visual Light Sensitivity Questionnaire-8 (VLSQ-8), 3) Assessment of Sleep Environment (ASE) questionnaire, 4) Modified Theory Framework of Acceptability (mTFA) questionnaire, 5) Feedback (1 Y/N and 6 multiple choice questions). |
| **sleepdiary** | N=26 csv files, each corresponding to the sleep diary of an individual participant.  |
| **wearlog** | N=26 csv files, each corresponding to the wear log participants filled multiple times/day. |

## Individual

This folder contains individual-level data for N=26 participant, each stored in a separate folder named after the participant ID (PID). Furthermore, it also contains a folder where the ActLumus files for the environmental light light logger (named “ambient”) are stored. The data within each participant folder follows the following structure.

The folder "ambient" contains the txt files and reports from the environmental light logger (ActLumus) placed on the rooftop of the laboratory, which measured data with a temporal frequency of 30 seconds. Furthermore, the xlxs file "cyepi_amb_schedule" contains, for every calendar week in which participants took part in the experiment, timestamps for when the experimenter cleaned the set-up and related comments.
